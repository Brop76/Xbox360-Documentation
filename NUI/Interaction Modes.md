Interaction Modes
The Mode Tab allows the user to select between Skeletal Tracking mode and Virtual Multi-touch mode.

Skeletal Tracking Mode - Skeletal Tracking Mode is the natural NUI mode for the Kinect system. Skeletal Tracking Mode translates motions into commands and allows the user to carry out all Runtime functions at a distance. In addition, skeletal tracking mode does not require screen calibration and also has access to the voice command features.

Virtual Multi-touch Mode - Virtual Multi-touch Mode is similar to a standard touch screen. Rather than making contact with a touch screen, Virtual Multi-touch allows the user to use movements and motions that do not require touching a screen. Virtual Multi-touch also allows the user to transform any surface into a virtual touch screen.
