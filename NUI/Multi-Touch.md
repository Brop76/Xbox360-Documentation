Multi-Touch
===========

Cursors
**Hovering** - A hovering cursor shows the relative location of the cursor on-screen. A hovering cursor is not interacting with the display and is used as a visual tool to make interacting more efficient.

**Interacting** - An interacting cursor currently engaged in a gesture.

Gestures
**Zoom**:

 <ul>
   
   <li>Zoom In - Zooming in allows the user to move in on an object or view. To zoom in, select two points on an object or view, and move your fingers apart from each other.</li>

   <li>Zoom Out - Zooming out allows the user to move away from an object or view. To zoom out, select two points on an object or view, and move your fingers towards each other.</li>
   
 </ul>



 



 

**Pan** - Panning allows the user to scroll horizontally over a display. To pan over a display, create a fist of the origin from which you wish to pan, and move your hand steadily away from the point of origin.

 

**Rotate** - Rotation allows the user to tilt and reorient an object or view. This function is especially useful in the 3D viewer. To rotate, select two points on an object or view, and rotate both fingers in the desired direction. Alternatively, you can select two points on an object or view and rotate one finger about another. Rotating the moving finger clockwise will rotate the object or view clockwise, while rotating the moving finger counterclockwise will rotate the object or view counterclockwise.
